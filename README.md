# CS-361-Microservice

How to request data:

Send the year that you want the microservice to tally the number of movies logged through a text file named 'microservice.txt'




How to recieve data:

The microservice will overwrite the 'microservice.txt' file used to start the microservice with the tally of movies watched that year.  The main program may then reread the text file.
